##Question 3
Write a function is R to solve the following problem: One dollar invested at an annual rate
of r percent compounded monthly for m months is worth

$$(1+\frac{r}{1200})^{m}$$

```{r}
dollar.invest <- function(p,y) ((1+(p/1200))**(y*12))
```

How much will one dollar be worth at the end of 6 years at 6% interest? 
```{r}
dollar.invest(6,6)
```

What about at 17%?
```{r}
dollar.invest(17,6)
```
