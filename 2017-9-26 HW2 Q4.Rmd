## Question 4
A monthly loan payment is computed from the principle of the loan, p, the number of years
of payments y, and the interest rate in percent i, according to the formula

$$payment = p*\frac{\frac{i}{1200}*(1+\frac{i}{1200})^{12*y}}{(1+\frac{i}{1200})^{12*y}-1}$$
```{r}
monthly.payment <- function(p,y,i) p*(((i/1200)*(1+(i/1200))^(12*y))/(((1+i/1200)^(12*y))-1))
```

What would the monthly payment be for a $150,000 mortgage at 6.5% for 30 years?
```{r}
monthly.payment(150000,30,6.5)
```
